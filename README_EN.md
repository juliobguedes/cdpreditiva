# Predictive Data Science

[Clique aqui para a versão em Português](README.md)

This repository contains all analysis made as solution to the problems raised by professor [Leandro Balby](https://github.com/lbalby) in the Predictive Data Science class during the 2018.2 semester at the Federal University of Campina Grande.

In each folder exists a division between notebooks, outputs and datasets. Each subfolder of this directory corresponds to a laboratory exercise, and in each one of them exists a README file that explains the exercise.

Inside the notebooks are my solutions to the questions raised and and the comment made by the professor to my solution will also be present in the README. Inside the folder also will be present a reviewed version of the notebook that fixes any problems or mistakes mentioned in the assessment.

I also want to thanks to [Hadrizia Santos](https://github.com/hadrizia), that acted as Assistant Professor of the class, and helped a lot in the exercises and activities.
